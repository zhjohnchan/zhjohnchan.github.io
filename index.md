## About Me

Hi, I am a third-year Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am supervised jointly by Prof. [Xiang Wan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3_kWigAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Guanbin Li](http://guanbinli.com/). I received the B.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019, and then became a PhD student at CUHK(SZ). My research lies at the intersection of **vision** and **language**, particularly focusing on **representation learning**. I am always open to collaboration. Feel free to drop me an e-mail. :-)

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am looking for an intern/postdoctoral position on **(Medical) Vision+Language**. I'd appreciate a ping if you see a job I might fit.</strong>

## Research Interests

- **Vision+Language:** Representation Learning
- **Medical Imaging:** Radiology Report Generation
